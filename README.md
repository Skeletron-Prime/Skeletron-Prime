## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is **Skeletron Prime**, and I'm a student with a keen interest in programming. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve been diving into the world of coding as a hobby, primarily using C# and exploring various libraries and frameworks.

## About Me

- **Username:** Skeletron Prime
- **Occupation:** Student
- **Programming Experience:** 1 year
- **Primary Language:** C#

## Skills and Expertise

During my journey in programming, I have gained experience and skills in several areas:

- **Languages:** Primarily C#
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** 
  - **Avalonia UI:** For creating cross-platform desktop applications.
  - **Unity:** For game development, where I've developed several games.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

### Time is Money

A productivity tool designed to help users track and manage the time spent on various projects. This application has been invaluable in improving my productivity by providing insights into how time is allocated across different tasks and projects.

### Unity Games

Iâ€™ve developed several games using Unity, which have allowed me to explore different aspects of game design and development. Each game project has been a learning experience, from implementing core gameplay mechanics to optimizing performance.

### Terraworld Engine

My most ambitious project to date is **Terraworld Engine**, a game engine I am actively developing. Terraworld Engine aims to provide a robust and flexible platform for creating diverse and high-quality games. This project represents a significant part of my current focus and passion.
